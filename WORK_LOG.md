| Jan 6  |  1:05pm-1:35pm  |                                                 I decided to use a trie (and maybe DFS?) to solve this problem set. I will use the trie to represent the dictionary of valid words, and will iterate using a nested for loop through each cell in the board. I still have to figure out how I will prevent duplicates and check the words against the dictionary. |
| Jan 6  |   3pm-3:30pm    |                I talked with Mr. Blick and decided to use DFS to find the possible words on the board starting from each cell. I also made the Node class be outside of the Trie class. I have been since working on making methods to add the next possible cells and check for valid cells, and have been thinking on how to approach this problem set further. |
| Jan 6  |   3:30pm-4pm    |                                                                                             I have continued to make edits to my code and work through the while-loop that I'll use to iterate through every letter in the board. I have also finished my first drafts of the sub methods that I mentioned in the last entry. I am now starting to debug my code. |
| Jan 6  |  5:20pm-5:50pm  |                                                                                                                              I have continued working on debugging my code. I'm currently trying to figure out how to fix an out of bounds error that I keep having, and also will have to figure out how to traverse back up the DFS path once I hit a dead end. |
| Jan 8  | 11:20am-11:55am |                                            I have begun implementing the recursive DFS approach we discussed in class. I deleted a lot of the methods I was using previously, and I also stopped using a Stack because it wasn't needed in this approach. I currently pass the edge case and tricky tests, however for all the other ones I return too few words. |
| Jan 9  |  5:15pm-5:25pm  | I used the debugger to see the process of how my code ran. I realized that I would just run DFS only on the top left square of the board, meaning I only got the valid words starting from that single cell. I then realized that I could fix this using a nested for loop to call DFS on every cell in the board. My code now works and passes all of the tests. |
| Jan 10 |  9:15am-9:25am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I made some final edits to the comments and formatting of my code before pushing and submitting. |
